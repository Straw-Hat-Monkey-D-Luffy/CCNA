Thing that you can touch
ex.
	1. cable
		x-based t-cabling(ethernet cabling)
		x=speed
		base=baseband
		T= twisted
		ex.
		   10,100,1000(x)
			  - 10 Mbit/s
			  - 100 Mbit/s
			  - 100 Mbit/s or 1Gbit/speed
			  
			baseband
				- only one base , one function
				- broadband opposite w/c is use at home 
				with multiple function.ex phone ,TV , net
			  
			cat 3, cat 4,cat 5(T)
				- more number more twist per meter
				- more twist means more copper
				- more copper means clearer signal
				
		2 flavors x-based t-cabling 
		1. straight through - different device type will use straight through cable between them.
				ex computer and switch, router and switch
				
		2. crossover - similar device type will use crossover cable between them.
				ex switch and switch, router and router , pc internet and a router internet
				
		2 types of x-based t-cable
		1. Shielded twisted pair - only use in place where there might be electromagnetic interference.
							ex ref, a/c if you run a unshielded behind ref or a/c which produce electromagnetic
							you might have signal degradation.
							
									
		2. unshielded twisted pair
		
		3. serial cable - v.35 cable
						- other cable that need to remember.
						- serial cable is connected to a serial port on a router. so between
						router and another router youll run a serial cable.
						
		4. rollover cables - console cables
						   - from console port of a cisco device to communication port of the PC
						   then you will open up a terminal emulation program such as tera term or putty.
						
		
	2. repeater
				- repeats the signal so the it wont be degrade
				100meter ----repeater ----signal repeat for another 100m
		
	3. hubs - hub is nothing more than a multi mode repeater.
			- hub will flood the signal out on all other ports except the one that originated the signal.
	
	Note: Router - works network layer 3
				and all network below w/cable
				is data-link and physical.
