Data link Layer 2

NOte : try to move away from saying the layer name instead
	use the number ex. layer 2 instead of data link layer.
	Because layer 2 is use by more experience people.
	
	Datalink layer - controls communication on the immediate  link
				between  two devices or immediate as the names says,
				the immediate Data link.
				
				- control communication between one device and the next 
				immediately connected device.
				
				circle represent a router.
				thunder bolt meas its a serial connection
				serial connection are your wide area links
				
				router -> router 
				router serail port <--> serail port router
				
				- controls communication  on the immediate link between two devices.
				
				What does the data at layer 1 looks like?
				- simply electricity, electrical signal or changes in voltage.
				- set of structure is called PDU
				
				Now in layer 2 the data has been put into a set structure.
				PDU - Protocol Data Unit
					- set structure.
					- at layer 2 the Protocol Data Unit is called a FRAME
					
				at layer 2 you need a addressing scheme.
				Media Access Control Address( MAC address)
				MAC - 48 bit in length
					- and its written in hexadecimal
					
				HexNumbers - 1 to 9, A through F
							A = 10
							B = 11
							C = 12
							D = 13
							E = 14
							F = 15
							
				MAC address ex  002A.ABCD.1234
					- each one of the character is 4 bits 
					
				OUI Field - Organizationally Unique Identifier.
						  - The 1st 24 bits of the MAC address.
						  - is designated by goverment body and is cannot be changed.
						  and its vendor specific.
						  
				Vendor - cisco , microsoft, dell. each one of this vendors are assigned several
						OUI and these OUI cannot be change.
						- the last 24 bits of MAC address, the vendor can do whatever they want with them.
						
				UL bit - Universal Local bit
					   - significant bit, most significant mean all the way tot he left. 
					   - resides on 2nd 4 bits .
					   - if that bit is turned oFF or second 4 bit is in zero(0). it means
					   the MAC address is universally unique. There wont be any other MAC address
					   like this in theory.
					   - If in any reason that the 2nd bit is turned on , it means that the address is 
					   assigned locally.
					   to turn on
					   
					   002A.ABCD.1234
					   022A.ABCD.1234
